#### Final assignment of the course "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" 


## Introduction

Over the years private companies have taken an interest in making space travel accessible to all, SpaceX has been one of the companies with more recognition in this subject, since its foundation in 2002, having achieved great success with their use of a "two stage rocket", which as the name imply are space vehicles that use two separate stages that provide propulsion consecutively to achieve orbital velocity, Space X can reduce the cost of each rocket from 165 million (from other suppliers) to 62 million thanks to this recovery of the first stage, which is the most expensive stage. For this project we will using data science to work for a new rocket company: Space Y founded by Allon Musk, we gather the information about Space X and determine if the first stage will land successfully and the characteristics for it to see how one can replicate the achievement from Space X.
